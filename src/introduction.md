# Introduction

Bagua is a distributed training utility developed by Kuaishou Technology and DS3 Lab. It aims to provide a system abstraction that is both flexible and performant to support state-of-the-art system relaxation techniques of distributed training. Currently it has integrated primitives like **Centralized Synchronous Communication (AllReduce)**, **Decentralized Synchronous Communication**, **Low Precision Communication** and many more. Its effectiveness has been verified in various scenarios, including VGG-16 and ResNet-50 on ImageNet, Bert Large on SQuAD and many industrial applications at Kuaishou. Powered by the new system design, Bagua has a great ability to implement and extend various state-of-the-art distributed learning algorithms. Researchers can easily develop new distributed training algorithms based on bagua, *without sacrificing system performance*.
